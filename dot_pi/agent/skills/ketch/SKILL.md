# Ketch

Use `ketch` for external research — web pages, OSS code, library docs.
- `ketch search "query"` / `ketch search "query" --scrape` for web results with optional full content (add `--multi` to federate across backends and rank-fuse)
- `ketch scrape <url> [url...]` for clean markdown from one or more URLs
- `ketch extract` for already-fetched/piped HTML (`curl ... | ketch extract`) — no fetch, no cache, no browser
- `ketch code "query" --lang go` for real OSS code with repo/line context
- `ketch docs "query" --library /org/repo` for version-aware library docs
- All commands support `--json`. `ketch config` reports active backends.
